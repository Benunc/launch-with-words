Launch With Words is a product that combines the features of a business coach with blogging prompts to encourage you to publish once a month. Follow the prompts. Publish. Easy!

== Description ==

In an ideal world, developers pair with professional copywriters. If budget allows, this creates the best experience for the launch and for payment. Unfortunately, many times the client writes the words (or you're waiting for it).  That's frustrating.

At same time, we know clients should use their sites. This gives them an appreciation of the tool you just built. A client who appreciates the site, uses it. And the cycle repeats.

The goal of this plugin is for the client to understand the site's intrinsic value, publish once a month, and generate leads.

You've worked hard to launch their site with words, so why not continue that habit?

<a href="https://bridgetwillard.com/launch-with-words/">Launch with Words</a> installs a year's worth of blog post prompts -- as drafts -- to encourage and guide your client (or yourself) in blogging best practices. Just say no to lorem ipsum and other placeholder text. Why install databases you just have to delete later?

These prompts are based upon Bridget Willard's ebook, "If You Don't Mind Your Business, Who Will?"
